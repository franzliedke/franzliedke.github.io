# About me

I am Franz Liedke, web developer and open-source enthusiast from Berlin, Germany.

I finished my studies of IT-Systems Engineering with a Master of Science from the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam.

Much of the time I have besides my job as a developer at [openHPI][openhpi], I use to co-lead the development of [Flarum][flarum].
Designed by [Toby Zerner][toby], Flarum is a next-generation forum software that's made to be easy to use, extend and install.

To build Flarum, we're using components of the [Laravel][laravel] web development framework.
Since I discovered Laravel, I have been an enthusiastic learner, used it for quite a few projects, and have become a [core][lara-vel] [contributor][lara-fw] and [meetup founder][lara-meetup].

My enthusiasm for forum software was born from my involvement in the [FluxBB][fluxbb] development team.
FluxBB is a free, open-source forum software that strives to be fast, light-weight and easy to use while only offering the features that are essential for running a forum.
I found FluxBB when I was literally searching for a forum that was easy to install and just worked.
FluxBB is still maintained - it is considered mostly feature-complete, but I am currently working on modernizing the aging PHP codebase.

I like to program in PHP, but have lots of experience with Ruby and JavaScript, too.
