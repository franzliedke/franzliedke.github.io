            <h1>About me</h1>
<p>I am Franz Liedke, web developer and open-source enthusiast from Berlin, Germany.</p>
<p>I finished my studies of IT-Systems Engineering with a Master of Science from the Hasso Plattner Institute in Potsdam.</p>
<p>Much of the time I have besides my job as a developer at <a href="https://open.hpi.de">openHPI</a>, I use to co-lead the development of <a href="http://flarum.org">Flarum</a>.
Designed by <a href="http://tobyzerner.com">Toby Zerner</a>, Flarum is a next-generation forum software that's made to be easy to use, extend and install.</p>
<p>To build Flarum, we're using components of the <a href="https://laravel.com">Laravel</a> web development framework.
Since I discovered Laravel, I have been an enthusiastic learner, used it for quite a few projects, and have become a <a href="https://github.com/laravel/laravel/graphs/contributors">core</a> <a href="https://github.com/laravel/framework/graphs/contributors">contributor</a> and <a href="http://www.meetup.com/laravel-berlin/">meetup founder</a>.</p>
<p>My enthusiasm for forum software was born from my involvement in the <a href="https://fluxbb.org">FluxBB</a> development team.
FluxBB is a free, open-source forum software that strives to be fast, light-weight and easy to use while only offering the features that are essential for running a forum.
I found FluxBB when I was literally searching for a forum that was easy to install and just worked.</p>
<p>I like to program in PHP, but have lots of experience with Ruby and JavaScript, too.</p>
